              <h2>Sport WEBMD</h2>
				<h5><b>Inspiration</h5></b>

				<p>Sport WEBMD was inspired by the great variety of injuries that many events in the olympics can cause. The seriousness of these injuries can be career ending if left untreated. Many injuries require attention from professionals which can cost hefty fees alongside long waiting times. We wanted to eliminate these problems along with the tedious preparation of meeting doctors and other professionals. Sport WEBMD solves these problems by being a simple questionnaire design that is very intuitive and simplistic. Sport WEBMD will theoretically diagnose you with the correct treatment which can be accessed from the comfort of your home without any hefty fees. Sport WEBMD breaks down these medical forms into a visually appealing and interactive UI, eliminating the hefty fees and time constraints along the way.</p>

				<h5><b>What it does</h5></b>

				<p>Sport WEBMD allows the user to fill in a simple survey like questionnaire in an easily navigable design, related to their symptoms, that will return their likely diagnoses and a thorough treatment method after several questions. Sport WEBMD does all this in an efficient, user friendly experience all for the cost of $0.  </p>

				<h5><b>How we built it</h5></b>

				<p>We built this website to accurately diagnose your injuries and recommend treatments accordingly. We built a prototype of this website on the design software Figma. We started off by creating the base structure of our questionnaire, along with deciding the theme and colour palette. Then, we created a few examples of common sport injuries along with their symptoms and organized all combinations using the Figma prototype software to establish Sport WEBMD. </p>

				<h5><b>Challenges we ran into</h5></b>

				<p>As a new team with no prior experience with hackathons, we faced many difficulties in learning each other's capabilities and limits. Creating an innovative idea that we could actually operate on was in itself a challenge as many of us had little coding experience. Assigning certain tasks to everyone was also challenging as we didn’t know each other's strengths and weaknesses. More, ineffective communications due to the various schedules of our teammates. 
				Working with figma, which was relatively new to us, we faced some challenges during our design process. While prototyping, we made some errors in connections between pages. We were also unfamiliar with Figma designing itself, so we had to learn the functions while executing our project.</p>

				<h5><b>Accomplishments that we’re proud of</h5></b>

				<p>First things first, we are all very proud of ourselves for being able to finish this project in such a short amount of time. This is the first ever hackathon that our group members have ever been a part of, so it was a huge accomplishment for us to finish the project. We were also able to include all possible combinations of our examples that we used, instead of just using one possible injury as our project. This made our project more reliable and made us become familiar with the workings of the Figma software. All in all, we extended our area of knowledge in certain aspects such as coding and designing. This gave us an opportunity to learn more, understand more, and apply more knowledge.</p>

				<h5><b>What we learned</h5></b>

				<p>Along with learning about common sport injuries and their treatments, this project enhanced our understanding of the concepts of the design software Figma. We also learned the importance of communication in a team, especially when there is a limited amount of time to complete a task. Furthermore, we further developed many skills such as responsibility, cooperation, and time management. Overall, building Sport WEBMD gave us an opportunity to learn and enhance many of the things we haven’t thought of before.</p>

				<h5><b>What’s next for our team</h5></b>

				<p>Sport WEBMD is still a design made with Figma that performs with some functionality that relies on the website Figma itself, so our next main thing would be to code an actual website of our own for Sport WEBMD or a website using reliable databases that are certified by multiple sports medicine doctors to ensure the information we give is reliable, accurate, and most effective. We also would like to add more options and flexibility with our questions and treatment methods in the future. Along with incorporating more software elements, some more next steps for our team would be creating a schedule on the day of our first meeting, and trying to adjust schedules according to the availability of other members. In closing, we would love to learn more about web development and incorporating some software aspects into our future projects.</p>
