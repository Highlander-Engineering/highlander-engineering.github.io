              <h2>Weather 2075</h2>
				<h5><b>Inspiration</h5></b>

				<p>Weather 2075 was inspired by the pressing issue of climate change. As many are aware, most of the changes that we’re seeing now have not happened for thousands of years. In the last 50 years, Earth’s average temperature has been steadily rising because of human activity. Climate change has many effects, from sea levels rising to increased heat waves, all of these changes would threaten the survival of mankind. Climate change is such an urgent issue, however, most people do not treat it as such. So, we wanted to create an app to help people visualize the effects of climate change in their areas so that people will be more aware of these changes and they will be more willing to take action to prevent climate change from reaching a point where there’s no going back. </p>

				<h5><b>What it does</h5></b>

				<p>Weather 2075 allows users to check the weather of multiple locations as well as the location’s predicted weather in the year 2075. It provides detailed information regarding the climate of a specific region and it informs users of potential threats such as air pollution, flooding, storms and acid rain. Weather 2075 informs users of the effects of climate change and aims to provide a realistic comparison between the present and the future reality of 2075. </p>

				<h5><b>How we built it</h5></b>

				<p>We built this app to display the current weather of three APAC demo cities and the predicted weather for them due to climate change. We built a prototype of this app on the design software Figma. We started off by creating the base structure of our weather app, along with the predicted weather. Then, we added further details such as personalizing each city’s weather report with an image from its country. Using the image, we contrasted the elements on the screen. We also added details such as humidity, precipitation, air quality and wind, along with an hourly report of the weather from 8 am to 5 pm for both the current weather and the predicted weather. Our main element in our predicted weather is the news section, which displays the possible catastrophic natural disasters that each city may experience in 2075. We also incorporated different transitions between our pages to keep the viewer interested.</p>

				<h5><b>Challenges we ran into</h5></b>

				<p>Since we were all relatively new to the software figma, we had some trouble with creating some elements that were suitable for the design, but we did not know how to in figma. We were also new to the prototyping process of figma and had to spend a lot of our time in beginning to become familiar with and experiment with the software. Although this did not take much of our time, it did set us a bit back during the designing process of our app. We also had a problem with the figma software not updating one of our news pages. This troubled us quite a bit as this was our last component to complete in our design. </p>

				<h5><b>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h5></b>

				<p>Firstly, we are proud of completing Weather 2075 in such a short time. We began creating this app the morning of Saturday EST and completed it the night of. We are also proud that we created such an attractive app by incorporating spectacular images and colour combinations to make Weather 2075 visually appealing. We have all become more familiar with the software figma, which we are very proud of as well. Furthermore, we were able to deal with our challenges and continue moving forward with the development of our app, which is a great accomplishment and one of our strengths as a team. </p>

				<h5><b>What we learned</h5></b>

				<p>During this hackathon, we learned about the potential effects of climate change and how it can be felt around the world. Even though we were aware that climate change is catastrophic, we never knew how regions could be impacted so severely and change so drastically in only 54 years. Apart from that, we also learned the importance of communication in a team, whether it’s reporting an issue to coordinating tasks, working together requires teammates to understand and support each other. We also learned the importance of time management since we had a short amount of time to complete this project, and on top of all this, we learned how to use figma efficiently and effectively. Overall, building Weather 2075 gave us an opportunity to learn and enhance many of the things we haven’t thought of before.</p>

				<h5><b>What's next for Weather 2075</h5></b>

				<p>The next steps for Weather 2075 are turning the figma design into either a webapp or a website and adding more cities from the APAC region. We could do this by replacing the dropdown menu with a search bar, so the user can find their region more effectively. This can help our app reach a larger audience by including all regions from the APAC region and can create awareness to a larger audience. We also would like to update our weather information more often so that our users can get the newest information. We would also like to add a section where it informs our users of the steps that they can take to prevent the effects of climate change in their areas. </p>
